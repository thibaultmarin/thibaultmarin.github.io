* Introduction 

This file contains my configuration for the [[https://awesome.naquadah.org/][awesome]] window manager along with
documentation of the different modules developed and used. The actual
configuration (a set of lua files) can be produced by running =org-babel-tangle=
on the original org file.

The resulting desktop is shown on Fig.\nbsp{}[[img-desktop-main]].  The following
bash script produces the image.  The most interesting part is the top wibox,
which is shown enlarged on Fig.\nbsp{}[[img-desktop]].

#+END_SRC

: "Org mode version 9.0.4 (release_9.0.4-270-ga10ddb @ ... )"

Most of the code in this configuration comes from the default =rc.lua= delivered
with awesome-wm.  On my system, it is located under =/etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua=.

Tangling this org file produces several lua files.  The main configuration is
contained in the =rc.lua= file (widgets, keybindings), and code for modules is
tangled to separate files.  To disable a component of this configuration, the
corresponding code block must be skipped during tangling.  To disable tangling
of an individual block, the preferred way is to add the =header-args= property
on the parent heading:

#+NAME: org-disable-tangle-example
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,** Disabled heading
   :PROPERTIES:
   :header-args+: :tangle no
   :END:
#+END_SRC

This can be done by adding the text manually or by using the =org-set-property=
function, which is bound to  by default.  Alternatively,
individual source blocks can be disabled by adding =:tangle no= on the
=#+BEGIN_SRC= line.

It is important to note that when tangling this file, any change made directly
to the lua files will be overridden by the code in this org file.  This can be
prevented by changing the permissions of the tangled files (see
http://orgmode.org/manual/tangle_002dmode.html).  Alternatively, the detangle
functionality in org-mode can be utilized to merge changes from the lua files
back to this org file: simply run =org-detangle= from the modified lua file and
changes should be merged back.  This requires the =#+PROPERTY: header-args
:comments link= option which is set at the top of this file.

This org file can also be exported to html to produce the documentation.  Note
that exporting this file (e.g. to HTML) executes some bash scripts (for
screenshots for instance), so use at your own risk.


** Requirements

- Since the configuration is written in an org-mode file, emacs is required to
  extract (tangle) the lua code.  A makefile is provided to run the tangle
  operation on this file from the command line (the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/make][GNU make]] utility is required
  to use the makefile).  It also requires a recent version of org-mode, and
  basic emacs modes for lua and python.

- The music player widget requires [[https://cmus.github.io/][cmus]] and uses [[http://eyed3.nicfit.net/][eyeD3]] to extract cover art from
  audio files.

- The bash script used to display the volume through OSD requires the =aosd_cat=
  command.

- The memory monitor widget uses the =htop= command to display a summary of the
  processes when moving the mouse over the widget.  This can be replaced by the
  =top= command for instance.

- The calendar widget lists events for each day using [[https://github.com/pimutils/khal][khal]].  I have it
  synchronized to my ([[http://owncloud.org][owncloud]]) CalDAV server using [[https://github.com/pimutils/vdirsyncer][vdirsyncer]].

- The mail widget relies on [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/][mu]] to find emails to show in the popup notification
  (emails are stored in maildir format).  This could be replaced by some other
  script for IMAP emails.

- The news widget requires a [[https://tt-rss.org/][Tiny Tiny RSS]] instance, and the [[https://github.com/Vassius/ttrss-pythom][ttrss-python]]
  package; a wrapper python script to get news feeds is provided in this file.

- If using the [[#global_prompt][global prompt module]], some modes include additional dependencies:

  - The music prompt requires [[http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html][mplayer]] and uses the =locate= program (part of the
    [[https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/][=findutils=]] package) to find audio files.

  - The [[#global_prompt_calc][calc]] prompt requires a python script to perform calculations from
    strings.  This script is provided in this org file.

- The transparency effect on focus (see the [[#effects_transparency][transparency]] section) requires a
  compositor, such as =xcompmgr=.

- When generating the HTML documentation (by running  on
  this buffer), screenshots are taken from the active desktop (assuming
  awesome-wm is the running desktop environment).  This requires the =scrot= and
  [[http://www.imagemagick.org][=imagemagick=]] programs.


** Makefile
A simple makefile can be used to generate the configuration files (=.lua=) and
the documentation.  Use =make= to update the configuration files from the org
source, =make doc-html= to export the org file into html.  The latex export
(=make doc-pdf=) is not supported (there is no syntax highlighting support for
lua in the =minted= package).

To get a reproducible =make= behavior, a minimal emacs initialization file is
provided here:

#+NAME: makefile-init-el
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

;; Assume default folder for emacs packages
(let ((default-directory  "~/.emacs.d/elpa/"))
  (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path))

;; Explicitly load required packages
(require 'org)
(require 'lua-mode)
(require 'python-mode)

;; Set source block languages
(org-babel-do-load-languages
 'org-babel-load-languages
 '( (emacs-lisp . t)
    (lua        . t)
    (makefile   . t)
    (python     . t)
    (shell      . t)))

;; Org options
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
(setq org-src-fontify-natively t)
(setq org-src-preserve-indentation t)
(setq org-edit-src-content-indentation 0)

;; Credential extraction function (uses auth-source)
(defun get-ttrss-cred (&optional url)
  (let ((ttrss-url (if url url "127.0.0.1:81/tt-rss"))
        (ttrss-user nil)
        ;;(ttrss-user "myuser")
        (ttrss-pass nil)
        ;;(ttrss-pass "mypassword")
        )
    (when (require 'auth-source)
      (let ((auth (nth 0 (auth-source-search :host ttrss-url
                                             :requires '(user secret)))))
        (when (and (plist-get auth :secret) (plist-get auth :user))
          (setq ttrss-pass (funcall (plist-get auth :secret))
                ttrss-user (plist-get auth :user)))))
    `(,ttrss-url ,ttrss-user ,ttrss-pass)))

;; Define credential extraction function before tangling
(add-hook 'org-babel-pre-tangle-hook 'get-ttrss-cred)
#+END_SRC

The makefile is relatively simple, one trick is to not use emacs in --batch mode
when generating the HTML documentation, since it seems to interact with syntax
highlighting.

#+NAME: makefile
#+BEGIN_SRC makefile

# Makefile for org file, with targets:
# all: Tangle source blocks
# doc-html: Export org-file to html
# doc-pdf: Export org-file to pdf

# Input org file
input = awesome-wm
src = $(input).org

# Emacs command
# Note: I can't seem to get syntax highlighting in the exported html when using
# --batch
emacs = emacs --batch --no-init-file --load makefile-init.el --find-file $(src)
emacs_batch = ${emacs} --batch

# Delete command
RM = rm -rf

* Basic setup 

This section contains general settings for the different desktop components:
search paths, default applications, main key modifiers and some boiler plate
code for error handling.


** Default programs
Define default programs.

#+NAME: src-setup-default-programs
#+BEGIN_SRC lua
-- Define default programs
terminal = "x-terminal-emulator"
termapps = "urxvt" -- "terminator"
editor = os.getenv("EDITOR") or "editor"
editor_cmd = terminal .. " -e " .. editor
internet_browser = "x-www-browser"
mail_reader = "thunderbird"
emacs = "emacs"
explorer = "xdg-open"
mixer = "pavucontrol"
music_player = "mplayer"
#+END_SRC


** Icons
Create an instance of the [[#icon_finder][Icon finder]] module.  It is used throughout the
configuration to find icons for programs and session operations ([[#shutdown][Shutdown menu]]).

#+NAME: src-setup-icons
#+BEGIN_SRC lua
-- {{ Icon finder
myiconfinder = icon_finder.new(awesome_paths.iconapps_dir)
-- }}
#+END_SRC


** Error handling

This is default code; it creates notifications when errors occur, which is
helpful to debug issues in =rc.lua=.

#+NAME: src-setup-error
#+BEGIN_SRC lua
-- {{{ Error handling
-- Check if awesome encountered an error during startup and fell back to
-- another config (This code will only ever execute for the fallback config)
if awesome.startup_errors then
    naughty.notify({ preset = naughty.config.presets.critical,
                     title = "Oops, there were errors during startup!",
                     text = awesome.startup_errors })
end

-- Handle runtime errors after startup
do
    local in_error = false
    awesome.connect_signal("debug::error", function (err)
        -- Make sure we don't go into an endless error loop
        if in_error then return end
        in_error = true

        naughty.notify({ preset = naughty.config.presets.critical,
                         title = "Oops, an error happened!",
                         text = tostring(err) })
        in_error = false
    end)
end
-- }}}

-- {{{ Helper functions

            instance:hide()
            instance = nil
        else
            instance = awful.menu.clients({ theme = { width = 250 } })
        end
    end
end
-- }}}
#+END_SRC


** Modkey setting

The modkey is the main key modifier for special bindings: use =Super= as main
modifier.  Also set =Alt= key.

#+NAME: src-setup-modkey
#+BEGIN_SRC lua
-- Default modkey.
-- Usually, Mod4 is the key with a logo between Control and Alt.
-- If you do not like this or do not have such a key,
-- I suggest you to remap Mod4 to another key using xmodmap or other tools.
-- However, you can use another modifier like Mod1, but it may interact with
-- others.
modkey = "Mod4"
altkey = "Mod1"
#+END_SRC


* Desktop 

This configuration is used with a dual screen system, where the widgets are
identical on both screens (except for the systray, which can only be added to
one screen).  An example of wibox produced by this file is shown on
Fig\nbsp{}[[img-desktop]].

The following bash snippet produces the screenshot shown on
Fig.\nbsp{}[[img-desktop]] on export (the result is cached, so it is not
re-generated if the content of the code block is not changed).

#+NAME: sh-scrot-wibox
#+BEGIN_SRC sh

** Layouts
This section defines the layouts for windows, I use the default code, with a few
entries disabled.

#+NAME: src-desktop-layouts
#+BEGIN_SRC lua
-- Table of layouts to cover with awful.layout.inc, order matters.
awful.layout.layouts =
{
    -- awful.layout.suit.tile,
    awful.layout.suit.tile.left,
    awful.layout.suit.tile.bottom,
    -- awful.layout.suit.tile.top,

    awful.layout.suit.magnifier,
    awful.layout.suit.corner.nw,
    awful.layout.suit.floating
}
-- }}}
#+END_SRC


** Theme
Themes are handled through the =beautiful= module, which creates the =beautiful=
table upon instantiation.  Themes are assumed to be located in sub-folders of
the paths defined by the =awesome_paths.themes_system_path= and
=awesome_paths.themes_custom_path= variables.  They are defined by a =theme.lua=
file (the filename can be customized by modifying
=theme_customatization.theme_file=) and possibly a =custom.lua= file (the
filename can be customized by modifying =theme_customatization.custom_file=).
The =theme.lua= file fully defines the theme (colors, icons, etc.) and the
=custom.lua= is used to locally modify theme values.

Some of the custom modules used in this configuration rely on an extended
=beautiful= table.  Any required field that is not in the original =beautiful=
table *must* be defined in the =themes/custom_defaults.lua= file and can be
overridden by individual themes in the =custom.lua= file.


*** Theme management module
The theme module has two main functions:
- list the available themes into a theme menu,
- define a complete =beautiful= table for a given theme.

The =theme_customatization.set_custom_theme= function takes a theme name as
input along with the [[#awesome_paths][=awesome_paths=]] variable.  It searches files named
=theme.lua= in the custom and system theme paths.  If a theme is found, the
=beautiful.init= function is called to initialize the =beautiful= table.  Next,
the =custom_defaults.lua= file is executed to complete the =beautiful= variables
with the custom ones required by this configuration.  Finally, the =beautiful=
table is augmented by inserting fields found in the theme's =custom.lua= file
(if present).

=themes/theme= file.  This file should contain a single line with the name of
the theme to use (see the [[src-theme-file][theme definition block]]).  Note that lines starting
with "#" are ignored (such lines occur when tangling this org-file, to allow
"de-tangling").  Also note that parsing is rudimentary so empty lines may cause
issues.

** Tags
Tags are similar to workspaces in other desktop environments.  My configuration
is for my home desktop, which has two screens.  It is only slightly modified
from the default: a few tags are named instead of numbered and the default
layout on some tags is customized.

- The first tag on each screen is for email: one for work using thunderbird and
  one for my personal email using mu4e (emacs).  These are not started
  automatically, I have a [[#rules][rule]] to force thunderbird on the second screen, and I
  manually start mu4e on the desired tag.
- The second tag on the second screen is used for my resident instances or
  [[http://newsbeuter.org/][newsbeuter]] (terminal RSS reader) and [[https://cmus.github.io/][cmus]] (terminal music player).  Both
  programs are launched on startup (see [[#startup_applications][Startup applications]]) and rules are used
  to place them on the right screen and tag (see the [[#rules][Rules]] section).

* Main bar 

This section is the main part of the configuration, it defines and configures
the widgets present on the main wibox (Fig.\nbsp{}[[img-desktop]]).

Note that the widgets defined here must be later added to the wibox, which is
done in the [[#wibox][Wibox]] section.

First, we create the simplest widget: a separator used to add visual spacing
between widgets.

#+NAME: src-main-misc
#+BEGIN_SRC lua
---- {{{ Separators
local separator = wibox.widget.textbox()
separator:set_markup(" <span foreground='grey'>·</span> ")

** Launchbar
In most desktop environments, application shortcuts are stored in =.desktop=
files that give the application name, icon, command, etc.  The specification is
available [[https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html][here]].  The standard =awful.widget.launcher= module allows to add
=.desktop= files to a launchbar which can be displayed in a wibox (as shown on
Fig.\nbsp{}[[img-desktop]]).

A few examples can be found online, most notably:
- [[https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Quick_launch_bar_widget/3.5][The basic quick launch bar]] requires =.desktop= files to include a =Position=
  field.  Usual =.desktop= files do not have this field so this is impractical.
- [[https://gist.github.com/alexander-yakushev/6343832][This script]] lists all the =.desktop= files in a given folder and adds them to
  the launchbar.  If the position field is missing, it is replaced, and
  launchers are added in alphabetical order.


*** Module definition
This version is based on the second code segment, the only difference is that
the Exec entry of the =.desktop= file is cleaned up from its command line
arguments, such as "%u" for firefox (they seem to cause problems when
launching).  The other addition is the use of the custom =icon_finder= module
described in the [[#icon_finder][Icon finder]] section.

#+NAME: module-launchbar
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

-- Quick launchbar widget for Awesome WM
-- http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Quick_launch_bar_widget/3.5
-- Put into your awesome/ folder and add the following to rc.lua:
--   local launchbar = require('launchbar')
--   local mylb = launchbar("/path/to/directory/with/shortcuts")
-- Then add mylb to the wibox.

local layout = require("wibox.layout")
local beautiful = require("beautiful")
local launcher = require("awful.widget.launcher")

local launchbar = {}

local function getValue(t, key)
   local _, _, res = string.find(t, key .. " *= *([^%c]+)%c")
   return res
end

function launchbar.new(filedir, icon_finder_helper)
   if not filedir then
      error("Launchbar: filedir was not specified")
   end
   launchbar.icon_dirs = icondir
   local items = {}
   local widget = layout.fixed.horizontal()
   local files = io.popen("ls " .. filedir .. "*.desktop")
   for f in files:lines() do
      local t = io.open(f):read("*all")
      cmd = getValue(t, "Exec")
      cmd = cmd:gsub("%%u", "")
      cmd = cmd:gsub("%%U", "")
      cmd = cmd:gsub("%%F", "")
      table.insert(
         items, {
            image = icon_finder_helper:find(getValue(t,"Icon")),
            command = cmd,
            position = tonumber(getValue(t,"Position")) or 255 })
   end
   table.sort(items, function(a,b) return a.position < b.position end)
   for _, v in ipairs(items) do
      if v.image then
         widget:add(launcher(v))
      end
   end
   return widget
end

return setmetatable(launchbar, { __call = function(_, ...)
                                    return launchbar.new(...) end })
#+END_SRC


*** Instantiation

The simplest way to use the module is to symlink =.desktop= files into a folder
and instantiate the launchbar object with the same folder as a parameter.  My
shortcuts are in a subfolder of the awesome config folder called =shortcuts=.

Note that the creation function also takes the icon finder instance as a
parameter (created in the [[#icons][Icons]] section).

#+NAME: src-main-launchbar
#+BEGIN_SRC lua
-- {{ Launchbar
local mylaunchbar = launchbar.new(awesome_paths.config_dir .. "/shortcuts/",
                                  myiconfinder)
-- }}
#+END_SRC


** Shutdown menu
By default, awesome has no menu to restart or shutdown the computer, just an
option to logout.  The following adds a menu with common shutdown, restart,
logout and lock items.  There is no support for hibernation but it should be
easy to add.

The shutdown and restart commands typically require the root password so the
sudoers file must be edited to allow the desired user to run the =shutdown=
command without password.  On Debian, the sudoers file can be edited by running
=sudo visudo= from a terminal.  My sudoers file contains the following:

#+NAME: visudo-shutdown
#+BEGIN_SRC conf
username ALL=SHUTDOWN
username ALL=NOPASSWD: SHUTDOWN
#+END_SRC

The menu is created as follows.  First, the icons are obtained from the [[#icons][icon
finder instance]], then the menu is built, wrapping commands with the
[[#my_utility_confirm][=confirm_action=]] function, which prompts for confirmation.  Note that the
filenames used to recover icons are the ones used in common themes (icons are in
found in folders set in the =awesome_paths= variable).

#+NAME: src-main-shutdown

** Main menu
The main menu is based on the default configuration with a few additions:
- Selected applications are added to an "Apps" submenu
- A theme selection menu
- A "Leave" menu to control the session (shutdown, restart, lock)

The icons are found using the [[#icon_finder][icon finder]] module.

This code block also configures the menubar, which can be used to quickly find
and launch applications by typing part of their name.

=khal= program is installed and configured.

** Mail
I use maildir for my personal email, and mu for indexing.  The mail widget uses
the vicious maildir widget, combined with custom functions to display a summary
of active emails when moving the mouse over the widget.

*** Module definition
This module was taken from [[https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Email_maildir_naughty_hoover][this post]], with small modifications to account for my
local setup.  In particular, the list of emails is obtained via a mu request
(=querystring=).

*** Widget setup

The vicious module is used to report the number of new messages in a list of
maildir folders.  The color of the widget text changes from
=beautiful.mail_fg_normal= to =beautiful.mail_fg_urgent= when new messages are
present.

Additionally, a right-click on the widget spawns a small menu with options to
open mail clients (thunderbird and mu4e).

#+NAME: src-main-mail
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

** cmus
Music is controlled by cmus, which is launched on startup.  The original widget
was taken from [[http://blog.rolinh.ch/linux/un-widget-controleur-pour-le-lecteur-audio-cmus-pour-awesome-wm/][here]].

The widget has the following features:
1. Show the current play state, song artist, title and current position in the
   wibox widget.
2. Toggle play / pause on click
3. Go to cmus on right click
4. On mouse over events, show a track listing of the current playing album in a
   notification window (popup), with the cover art (parsed from the file
   metadata using eyeD3).
5. A function to search for a given album by name or select an album at random
   and play it in cmus ([[#cmus_play][Quick play command]]).  This function is not used by the
   widget but by the [[#global_prompt][global prompt module]].

An example of the widget in action is shown on Fig.\nbsp{}[[img-cmus-popup]].

This module is not generic, modifications are likely to be necessary if the
setup is different from mine.  My music library is organized as follows:
- All my music is in =~/data/music/= where each album is in a separate folder
  with name =YYYY-ARTIST-ALBUM= (the quick play command explicitly assumes this
  format, so it probably won't work with different conventions).  The format is
  set in a regular expression (=cmus_album_regex= in the [[#cmus_global_variables][Global variables]]
  section).
- Songs all have the cover art in their metadata.  This is where the cover art
  displayed in the popup notification comes from.  There is no clever mechanism
  to pick an image file in the album folder, although it should be possible to
  implement one.
- The extracted cover art is cached in =~/cmus_img/=.

This is admittedly pretty constraining, but supporting more generic setups seems
feasible, with some work.


*** Imports
First, import the necessary libraries.

#+NAME: module-cmus-import
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

local awful = require("awful")
local naughty = require("naughty")
local beautiful = require('beautiful')
local util = require("awful.util")
local my_utility = require("my_utility")
#+END_SRC


*** Utility functions
A few utility functions are used in the module:
- =get_path= :: Extract path from filename.
- =cmusover_addToWidget= :: Show album popup on mouse over.
- =get_mp3_info= :: Get a string representation of file ID3 tags using eyeD3.  The
  output string is of the form "track number - track title - track length"
  where the track title is padded so that the whole string length is
  =strlen= (this does not seem to work with accentuated letters).

#+NAME: module-cmus-utils
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

function get_path(str, sep)
    sep = sep or '/'
    return str:match("(.*" .. sep .. ")")
end

function cmusover_addToWidget(widget)
   widget:connect_signal(
      'mouse::enter', function () cmus_popup(0) end)
   widget:connect_signal(
      'mouse::leave', function () naughty.destroy(popup) end)
end

function get_mp3_info(fname, strlen)
   -- FIXME: fix padding for accentuated letters.
   cmd = 'eyeD3 --no-color ' .. '"' .. fname .. '"'
   out = io.popen(cmd):read("*all")
   track = string.gsub(string.match(out, 'track: %d*'),
                       'track: ', '')
   title = string.gsub(string.match(out, 'title: %C*'),
                       'title: ', '')
   time_str = string.match(out, 'Time: [%d:]*')
   if time_str == nil then
      time = "-"
   else
      time = string.gsub(time_str, 'Time: ', '')
   end
   sfmt = string.format('%%-%d.%ds', strlen, strlen)
   return string.format('%2d - '..sfmt..' - %s', track, title, time)
end
#+END_SRC


*** Global variables
Setup variables are used to find albums by folder name in the music folder
(using the =cmus_album_regex= variable) and to cache the track listing and cover
art.

#+NAME: module-cmus-cover-setup
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

-- Album folder regexp
cmus_album_regex = "^[0-9]\\{4\\}-"

-- Album display (with cover)
cmus_file_g = ""
cmus_img_g = ""
cmus_img_fold = os.getenv("HOME") .. "/cmus_img/"
cmus_album_g = ""
cmus_album_list_g = ""
cmus_file_list_g = nil
#+END_SRC


*** Check running instance
This function detects whether a cmus instance is running by requesting its PID.

#+NAME: module-cmus-get-pid
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

-- Get cmus PID to check if it is running
function getCmusPid()
   local fpid = io.popen("pgrep cmus")
   local pid = fpid:read("*n")
   fpid:close()
   return pid
end
#+END_SRC


*** Controls
A cmus instance can be controlled from a terminal using the =cmus-remote=
command.  The following function passes simple controls to cmus-remote (play,
pause, stop, next, etc.).  In practice only the play / pause functionality is
used: clicking on the widget toggles the play state (play / pause).


#+NAME: module-cmus-control
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

-- Enable cmus control
function cmus_control (action)
   local cmus_info, cmus_state
   local cmus_run = getCmusPid()
   if cmus_run then
      cmus_info = io.popen("cmus-remote -Q"):read("*all")
      if not cmus_info then return end
      cmus_state = string.gsub(string.match(cmus_info, "status %a*"),
                               "status ","")
      if cmus_state ~= "stopped" then
         if action == "next" then
            io.popen("cmus-remote -n")
         elseif action == "previous" then
            io.popen("cmus-remote -r")
         elseif action == "stop" then
            io.popen("cmus-remote -s")
         end
      end
      if action == "play_pause" then
         if cmus_state == "playing" or cmus_state == "paused" then
            io.popen("cmus-remote -u")
         elseif cmus_state == "stopped" then
            io.popen("cmus-remote -p")
         end
      end
   end
end
#+END_SRC


*** Popup
The popup notification (Fig.\nbsp{}[[img-cmus-popup]]) shows the content of the
global variables defined earlier (see [[#cmus_global_variables][global variables]]) and updated by the
=cmus_hook= function (see the [[#cmus_hook][Main hook]] section).

#+NAME: module-cmus-popup
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

function cmus_popup(timeout)
   local img
   if util.file_readable(cmus_img_g) then
      img = cmus_img_g
   else
      img = nil
   end
   if cmus_album_list_g ~= "" then
      popup = naughty.notify({
            title = cmus_album_g,
            text = cmus_album_list_g,
            font = "monospace 10",
            icon = img,
            icon_size = 192,
            timeout = timeout,
            hover_timeout = 0.5,
            screen = awful.screen.focused()
      })
   end
end
#+END_SRC

The following bash script, uses =awesome-client= to spawn the popup notification
and performs a screen capture (Fig.\nbsp{}[[img-cmus-popup]]).

#+NAME: sh-scrot-cmus-info
#+BEGIN_SRC sh

# Could get these from xrandr

*** Quick play command
The quick play command =cmus_play= is used to start playing a new album, picked
randomly (=rand= mode) or from a string (=album= mode).  There is no single song
mode; it could probably be added, but I use a direct search and mplayer to play
individual songs via the [[#global_prompt_music][global prompt module]].

Once the folder to play is found, some work is required to get cmus to play it.
First, cmus must be in playlist mode (i.e. the =play_library= flag must of set
to false).  =cmus-remote= is used to interrogate the running instance and then a
second time to disable the =play_library= mode if necessary.  Then, the current
playlist is cleared (=cmus-remote -c=), the desired folder is added to the
playlist and playback is started.  A combination of stop, next and play commands
seems to be the best way to get the playlist to start.

The commands are written into a temporary bash script, which is executed at the
end of the function (I was not able to get this to work without the intermediate
bash script).

#+NAME: module-cmus-play
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

function cmus_play(mode, fold)
   local out
   if mode == "rand" then
      alb_sel_cmd = "ls " .. global_prompt.music_folder .. " | " ..

   elseif mode == "album" then
      alb_sel_cmd = "ls " .. global_prompt.music_folder .. " | " ..
         "grep \"" .. cmus_album_regex .. "\" | grep -i \"" .. fold .. "\" |" ..
         "tail -n1"
   end
   local f = io.popen(alb_sel_cmd)
   out = f:read("*all"):gsub("\n$", "")
   f:close()

   -- Determine if play_library flag need to be toggled
   f = io.popen("cmus-remote -Q | grep play_library | awk '{print $3}'")
   local lib_flag = f:read("*all"):gsub("\n$", "")
   f:close()

   if lib_flag == "true" then
      mp_cmds = { "cmus-remote -C \"toggle play_library\"" }
   else
      mp_cmds = {}
   end

   table.insert(mp_cmds, "cmus-remote --stop")
   table.insert(mp_cmds, "cmus-remote --next")
   table.insert(mp_cmds, "cmus-remote --play")
   if mp_cmds then
      local file
      local flag_batch = true -- problems when not using this
      if flag_batch then
         file = io.open("/tmp/cmus.sh", "w")
      end
      for _, cmd in ipairs(mp_cmds) do
         if flag_batch then
            file:write(cmd .. "\nsleep 1\n")
         else
            awful.spawn.with_shell(cmd)
         end
      end
      if flag_batch then
         file:close()
         awful.spawn.with_shell("bash /tmp/cmus.sh")
      end
   end
end
#+END_SRC


*** Main hook
The =cmus_hook= function is responsible for updating the text of the music
widget, and the content of the popup notification.  It is run on a frequent
timer (2 seconds by default).

The hook first checks for the presence of a running cmus instance using the
[[#cmus_pid][=getCmusPid=]] function.  If a running instance is found and its status is
currently "playing" or "paused", the hook proceeds to extract information about
the currently playing file.  As shown in Fig.\nbsp{}[[img-desktop]], the widget
shows the playing status with a unicode character (play / pause), the artist and
song title and the track position (formatted as "position" / "duration").

The rest of the function populates the album track list.  =cmus_album_str=
contains the album name and the year between parentheses.  If the album name is
different from the one cached in the [[#cmus_global_variables][global variable]] =cmus_album_g=, the track
list is updated.

To update the track list, the cover art is first extracted from the current
playing file using the eyeD3 utility.  This requires all audio files to contain
the album art as metadata.  The extracted cover art is saved in the folder
defined by the =cmus_img_fold= variable.

Further, all the =.mp3= files in the same folder as the file being played are
listed, their metadata is extracted using the [[#cmus_utils][=get_mp3_info=]] function, and they
are added to the =cmus_album_list_g= variable.  The song currently playing is
highlighted in the list.

** Tiny Tiny RSS
The RSS widget relies on an instance of Tiny Tiny RSS and the [[https://github.com/Vassius/ttrss-python][ttrss python
package]].  Extraction of RSS entries is performed using the following python
wrapper script.

The script takes as parameters the URL to the Tiny Tiny RSS instance, a user
name and a password.  It gathers unread feeds and prints them into a string.  It
also adds the option to get the credentials from the keyring
(e.g. =gnome-keyring= or =KWallet=).  This functionality requires the =keyring=
python package.

*** Credentials

In my setup, credentials are stored in the =~/.authinfo.gpg= file.  The
following emacs-lisp snippet defines a function to get the username and password
from the url.  This should also work for the un-encrypted version using
=.authinfo=.

If not using authinfo, the credentials can be hard-coded in this emacs-lisp
snippet.  In the following source block, replace line\nbsp{}[[(user-nil)]] by
line\nbsp{}[[(user-hardcoded)]] and line\nbsp{}[[(pass-nil)]] by
line\nbsp{}[[(pass-hardcoded)]] and set the correct password.

#+NAME: ttrss-credentials
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n -r
(defun get-ttrss-cred (&optional url)
  (let ((ttrss-url (if url url "127.0.0.1:81/tt-rss"))
        (ttrss-user nil)                                         (ref:user-nil)
        ;;(ttrss-user "myuser")                            (ref:user-hardcoded)
        (ttrss-pass nil)                                         (ref:pass-nil)
        ;;(ttrss-pass "mypassword")                        (ref:pass-hardcoded)
        )
    (when (require 'auth-source)
      (let ((auth (nth 0 (auth-source-search :host ttrss-url
                                             :requires '(user secret)))))
        (when (and (plist-get auth :secret) (plist-get auth :user))
          (setq ttrss-pass (funcall (plist-get auth :secret))
                ttrss-user (plist-get auth :user)))))
    `(,ttrss-url ,ttrss-user ,ttrss-pass)))
#+END_SRC

Note that this approach saves the credentials unencrypted in the =ttrss.lua=
module.  It may be preferable to rely on a keyring to get the password.
However, the =authinfo= approach can still be safely used with version control
if the org file is version-controlled and the tangled lua files are not.


*** tt-rss module
The tt-rss module defines functions used by the [[#ttrss-widget][widget]]:
- =ttrss_get_count= :: return the number of unread feeds,
- =ttrss_get_feeds= :: return a formatted list of unread feeds,
- =ttrss_mark_read= :: mark all feeds as read,
- =ttrss_set_mouseover= :: setup the widget to display a popup notification with
  the list of unread feeds on mouse-over.

These functions internally use the =ttrss_get= function which interacts with the
[[#ttrss-wrapper-py][=ttrss-wrapper.py=]] python script.

*** tt-rss widget
The ttrss widget is a textbox with the text updated on a timer (every 10 minutes
by default) to display the number of unread items.  On a mouse over event, a
list of unread feeds is shown in a popup notification.  Finally, click actions
are added to the widget:
- a left click shows a menu with entries "Refresh" and "Mark as read" which
  respectively refresh the widget count and mark all unread items as read,
- a right click spawns a menu with shortcuts to the terminal and GUI RSS
  applications newsbeuter and liferea.

* Bindings 

Bindings include mouse click actions for the different widgets and windows as
well as keyboard shortcuts.


** Mouse

Mouse bindings are defined using tables filled by =awful.button= elements.


*** General bindings

This section handles mouse actions on an empty workspace:
- a right-click pops-up the [[#main_menu][main menu]],
- the mouse wheel moves to the previous / next tag.

#+NAME: src-bindings-mouse-root
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

#+END_SRC


*** Windows

Mouse actions for clicks on windows are defined here:
- a left click sets the focus,
- =modkey= + left click drag moves the window,
- =modkey= + right click drag resizes the window.
The =clientbuttons= table created by this block is later added to each window
via the [[#rules][rules]] mechanism.

#+NAME: src-bindings-mouse-client

    awful.button({ modkey }, 3, awful.mouse.client.resize))

-- }}}
#+END_SRC


*** Tag list
The mouse can be used to navigate between between tags, when the mouse is over
the tag list widget:
- a left click on a tag icon moves to the corresponding tag,
- =modkey= + left click moves the current window to the desired tag,
- a right click toggles the visibility of the corresponding tag (on top of the
  current tag, so all windows from the tag under the mouse will appear in the
  currently active tag),
- =modkey= + right click toggles the current tag's visibility on the tag under
  the mouse,
- the mouse wheel goes to the previous / next tag.

** Keyboard
Keyboard bindings are split into two categories: global bindings and client
(windows) bindings.

*** Global bindings 

Keybindings are defined in subsections, and can be individually disabled by
setting the =tangle= property to =no=.

First, we initialize the table for the keys.

#+NAME: src-bindings-keyboard-start
#+BEGIN_SRC lua
-- {{{ Key bindings
globalkeys = {}
#+END_SRC

**** Shortcuts popup

Display the help popup.

#+NAME: src-bindings-keyboard-help
#+BEGIN_SRC lua
globalkeys = awful.util.table.join(globalkeys,
    awful.key({ modkey, }, "s", hotkeys_popup.show_help,
       {description="show help", group="awesome"})
)
#+END_SRC



**** Tags

tags.

* Wibox 
The wibox is the top bar shown on Fig.\nbsp{}[[img-desktop-main]].  It is populated
with widgets previously set up, including the [[#main_menu][main menu]], [[#tags][tag list]], task list and
the custom [[#cmus][music]] / [[#email][email]] / [[#ttrss][news]] widgets.

A wibox is created on each screen; the only difference between the screens is
that only a single instance of the system tray widget can be added (it is added
on screen 1 for my configuration).

The wibox is decomposed into three sections: left, center and right.  Widgets
are added to each section and then concatenated into a single layout which is in
turn added to the wibox.

* Rules
Awesome allows the definition of rules for program window management based on
their class or instance name.  If the link is still up, [[https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Understanding_Rules][this page]] contains some
basic description of rules.

Only a few simple rules are defined here:
- Set of few programs as "floating": mplayer, pinentry, gimp.
- Fix cmus, newsbeuter on the second tag of the second screen.
- Thunderbird goes on the first tag of the second screen.
- I had issues with =ristretto= starting in a maximized state; I am not sure
  whether it is necessary, but I am explicitly disabling the "maximized" option
  here.

This is a module used to attempt to automatically find icons for programs.  It
is used by the [[#launchbar][launchbar]] module, and menus ([[#main_menu][main menu]] and [[#shutdown][shutdown menu]]).  It
searches for icons in folders defined in the =awesome_paths.iconapps_dir=
variable (=png= and =svg= files).

* Global prompt 
The default awesome-wm configuration provides two prompts: one to execute shell
commands and one to execute lua code.  The =global_prompt= module is a custom
module aimed at simplifying the addition of prompts, similar to launchers such
as gnome-do, kupfer for instance.

A few prompts are also defined in this module, more can be added as needed.

** Imports

This module requires basic awesome-wm libraries, and file system tools.

#+NAME: module-global_prompt-setup
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

local awful = require("awful")
local util = require("awful.util")
local lfs = require("lfs")
local runorraise = require("runorraise")
local capi = {
  tag = tag,
  client = client,
  keygrabber = keygrabber,
  mouse = mouse,
  screen = screen
}
local io = io
local naughty = require("naughty")
local cmus = require("cmus")

global_prompt = {}
#+END_SRC


** Utilities
First, define some helper functions:

- =generic_completion_wrapper= :: build completion from a list of items.

- =table.val_to_str= :: convert value to string.

- =table.key_to_str= :: convert table key to string.

- =table.tostring= :: convert table to string.

#+NAME: module-global_prompt-utils
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

function generic_completion_wrapper(kw, list, str, cur_pos, ncomp)
   out_str, out_pos = awful.completion.generic(str, cur_pos, ncomp, list)
   out_str = kw .. " " .. out_str
   out_pos = out_pos + kw:len() + 1
   return out_str, out_pos
end

function table.val_to_str ( v )
  if "string" == type( v ) then
    v = string.gsub( v, "\n", "\\n" )
    if string.match( string.gsub(v,"[^'\"]",""), '^"+$' ) then
      return "'" .. v .. "'"
    end
    return '"' .. string.gsub(v,'"', '\\"' ) .. '"'
  else
    return "table" == type( v ) and table.tostring( v ) or
      tostring( v )
  end
end

function table.key_to_str ( k )
  if "string" == type( k ) and string.match( k, "^[_%a][_%a%d]*$" ) then
    return k
  else
    return "[" .. table.val_to_str( k ) .. "]"
  end
end

function table.tostring( tbl )
  local result, done = {}, {}
  for k, v in ipairs( tbl ) do
    table.insert( result, table.val_to_str( v ) )
    done[ k ] = true
  end
  for k, v in pairs( tbl ) do
    if not done[ k ] then
      table.insert( result,
        table.key_to_str( k ) .. "=" .. table.val_to_str( v ) )
    end
  end
  return "{" .. table.concat( result, "," ) .. "}"
end
#+END_SRC


** Prompts

The prompts included in the module are listed here.  Prompts are called by
entering a keyword, followed by some arguments in the promptbox (i.e. the user
input is of the form =KEYWORD ARGS=).  A prompt is defined as follows:

#+NAME: global_prompt_template
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

global_prompt.prompt_TEMPLATE = {
   keyword={"?", "h"}, -- list of strings
   help="Help message for prompt",
   run_function = function(kw, name)
      -- Execute code
   end,
   comp_function = function(kw, name, cur_pos, ncomp)
      return generic_completion_wrapper(kw, { "AUTOCOMPLETE-WORD-1",
                                              "AUTOCOMPLETE-WORD-2" },
                                        name, cur_pos, ncomp)
}
#+END_SRC

A prompt is a table with the following entries:
- =keyword= :: List of keywords for prompt.
- =help= :: Help message (for use with [[#global_prompt_help][help prompt]]).
- =run_function= :: Function to run when calling the prompt.  The =name=
  parameter is the =ARGS= string passed from the prompt (the user input is
  =KEYWORD ARGS=).
- =comp_function= :: Completion function which can be created using
  [[#global_prompt_utils][=generic_completion_wrapper=]].


*** help
The help prompt prints a list of the available prompts, along with the
corresponding help text as shown on Fig.\nbsp{}[[img-global_prompt-help]].  The
keyword is =h= or =?=.

#+NAME: module-global_prompt-help
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

global_prompt.prompt_help = {
   keyword={"?", "h"}, help="Show a list of available commands",
   run_function = function(kw, name)
      help_str = ""
      for _, p in ipairs(global_prompt.prompt_list) do
         help_str = help_str .. "<b>["
         for ki, key in ipairs(p["keyword"]) do
            if ki > 1 then
               help_str = help_str .. ", "
            end
            help_str = help_str .. key
         end
         help_str = help_str .. "]</b>: " .. p["help"] .. "\n"
      end
      naughty.notify( { text = "<b><u>Command list</u></b>\n" .. help_str } )
   end,
   comp_function = nil
}
#+END_SRC

The following script manually spawns the help box shown on
Fig.\nbsp{}[[img-global_prompt-help]] and performs a screenshot.

*** session

The session prompt offers session management commands (shutdown, restart,
logout, lock), similar to the [[#shutdown][shutdown menu]].  The keyword is =s=, so =s
shutdown= will trigger a shutdown (with confirmation prompt).

#+NAME: module-global_prompt-session
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

global_prompt.prompt_session = {
   keyword={"s"}, help="Session control (shutdown, restart, logout, lock)",
   run_function = function(kw, cmd)
      -- list of commands: mplayer -input cmdlist | more
      if cmd == "shutdown" then
         my_utility.confirm_action(
            function()
               awful.spawn('sudo /sbin/shutdown -h now')
            end, "Shutdown")
      elseif cmd == "restart" then
         my_utility.confirm_action(
            function()
               awful.spawn('sudo /sbin/shutdown -r now')
            end, "Restart")
      elseif cmd == "logout" then
         my_utility.confirm_action(
            function()
               awesome.quit()
            end, "Logout")
      elseif cmd == "lock" then
         awful.spawn('xscreensaver-command -lock')
      end
   end,
   comp_function = function(kw, name, cur_pos, ncomp)
      return generic_completion_wrapper(kw, { "shutdown", "restart", "logout",
                                              "lock" },
                                        name, cur_pos, ncomp)
   end
}
#+END_SRC


*** window

The window prompt allows to quickly jump to an existing window.  It lists open
windows by their class and name and compares the argument to the listed
class / title pairs.  Tab completion is also implemented.

#+NAME: module-global_prompt-window
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

global_prompt.prompt_window = {
   keyword={"j"}, help="Jump to window",
   run_function = function(kw, cmd)
      cmd_l = string.lower(cmd)
      client_list = {}
      for s = 1, screen.count() do
         client_list_s = capi.client.get(s)
         for _, c in ipairs(client_list_s) do
            if cmd_l == string.lower(c.class .. ": " .. c.name) then
               awful.client.jumpto(c)
               return
            end
            table.insert(client_list, {c, c.class .. ": " .. c.name})
         end
      end
      for _, c in ipairs(client_list) do
         if string.lower(c[1].name):find(cmd_l) or
            string.lower(c[1].class):find(cmd_l) then
            awful.client.jumpto(c[1])
            return
         end
      end
   end,
   comp_function = function(kw, name, cur_pos, ncomp)
      client_list = {}
      for s = 1, screen.count() do
         client_list_s = capi.client.get(s)
         for _, c in ipairs(client_list_s) do
            table.insert(client_list, string.lower(c.class .. ": " .. c.name))
         end
      end
      return generic_completion_wrapper(kw, client_list,
                                        name, cur_pos, ncomp)
   end
}

*** calc
The calculator prompt uses a python script to perform calculations.  It allows
simple math operations including common functions (e.g. trigonometric,
logarithmic etc.).

**** Internal script
The calculator script was adapted from [[http://www.peterbe.com/plog/calculator-in-python-for-dummies][this one]].

#+END_SRC


**** Prompt definition

The definition of the prompt is straightforward: the arguments are wrapped
around double quotes and passed to the =calc.py= script.  The result is shown in
a popup notification.

#+NAME: module-global_prompt-calc
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

global_prompt.calc_cmd = "python3 " .. awesome_paths.config_dir ..

      if expr.sub(1, 1) ~= "\"" then
         expr = "\"" .. expr
      end
      if expr.sub(-1, 1) ~= "\"" then
         expr = expr .. "\""
      end
      local c, err = io.popen(global_prompt.calc_cmd .. " " .. expr)
      local result = c:read("*all"):gsub("\n$", "")
      c:close()
      naughty.notify({ text = string.sub(expr, 2, -2) .. " = " .. result,
                       timeout = 10 })
   end,
   comp_function = nil
}
#+END_SRC


*** cmus

The cmus prompt is an interface to the [[#cmus_play][cmus quick play command]].  The supported
arguments are:
- play/pause/stop/next/prev :: control playback,
- info :: spawn the [[#cmus_popup][cmus popup notification]],
- random :: play a random album,
- album :: play an album with title matching the remaining prompt arguments.


#+NAME: module-global_prompt-cmus
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

global_prompt.prompt_cmus = {
   keyword={"cm"}, help="cmus remote",
   run_function = function(kw, cmd)
      -- list of commands: mplayer -input cmdlist | more

#+END_SRC


*** music
The music prompt plays individual music files in =mplayer=, as opposed to the
cmus tools, which play albums using =cmus=.  The music folder is indexed into
the =music.db= file using the =updatedb= program, and song searches are
performed using the =locate= program (both parts of the =findutils= package).
The =music.db= file is updated on a schedule (daily) via =crontab=:

#+NAME: cron-musicdb-update
#+BEGIN_SRC conf

# Crontab entry for music database update
0 9 * * * updatedb --require-visibility 0 -U ~/data/music/ -o ~/data/music/music.db > ~/log/update_musicdb.log
#+END_SRC

The music prompt defines two keywords:
- =m= :: play an audio file (with file format in the list defined by
  =global_prompt.music_ext_list=).  The extra argument is either a full path
  to a file name in which case the file is played or a search string which is
  used to interrogate the =music.db= database and obtain a file to play.
- =mc= :: control the existing mplayer instance via a named pipe constructed
  using =mkfifo=.  Available commands are =pause= (or =p=) and =quit= (or
  =q=).

Note that the spawned mplayer instance is given a custom class name (=-c
tmplayer=) to apply a custom [[#rules][rule]] to it: it is placed on the same screen and
client as the main cmus instance.

The completion function for the =m= keyword performs a search on the argument
and returns the list of matching files in the =music.db= database.  Completion
for the =mc= keyword simply lists the available commands.

*** web                                                     :feature_request:

The web prompt was originally aimed at handling questions where the answer would
be obtained from a web search (e.g. using [[https://duckduckgo.com/api][duckduckgo]] search API).  This is
currently not implemented and the web prompt simply spawns a web browser window,
and starts a duckduckgo search with the input arguments.

#+NAME: module-global_prompt-web
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

global_prompt.search_url = "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s"
global_prompt.prompt_web = {
   keyword={"w"}, help="Web search",
   run_function = function(kw, expr)
      is_url = string.find(expr, "[.][0-9a-zA-Z]+$")
      naughty.notify({text=is_url})
      if is_url == nil then
         expr_search = string.gsub(expr, "%s+", "+")
         expr_url = string.format(global_prompt.search_url, expr_search)
      else
         expr_url = expr
      end
      awful.spawn.with_shell(internet_browser .. " " .. expr_url)
   end,
   comp_function = nil
}
#+END_SRC


** Main prompt

Once the prompts are defined they are added to the =prompt_list= table.  The
final part of the module defines the main hook handling user input.  The first
word in the user input is matched against known keywords, and, if a matching
prompt keyword is found, the remaining arguments are passed to the corresponding
=run_function= and =comp_function= to handle =ENTER= and =TAB= key presses
respectively.


#+NAME: module-global_prompt-main

* Startup applications
The end of the =rc.lua= file contains a list of applications to run on startup.
Programs are spawned using the [[#my_utility_run_once][=run_once=]] utility.  The applications launched on
startup are:
- =dual_default.sh= which is a =xrandr= script to setup my monitors
- =numlock&= which switches the numlock key on
- the dropbox daemon
- the network-manager applet
- =xscreensaver= for screen locking
- the UPnP server [[https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Rygel][=rygel=]]
- the RSS reader =newsbeuter=
- the music player =cmus=

#+NAME: src-startup-apps
#+BEGIN_SRC lua
my_utility.run_once(awesome_paths.config_dir .. "/scripts/dual_default.sh")
my_utility.run_once("numlockx&")
my_utility.run_once(awesome_paths.home_dir .. "/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd") -- dropbox
my_utility.run_once("nm-applet") -- networking
my_utility.run_once("xscreensaver -nosplash")
my_utility.run_once("rygel")
-- Compositing (required for transparency)
--my_utility.run_once("xcompmgr")

my_utility.run_once(termapps .. " -name newsbeuter -e newsbeuter")
my_utility.run_once(termapps .. " -name cmus -e cmus")

--run_or_raise(terminal)
--my_utility.run_once("pidgin",nil,nil,2)
#+END_SRC

** Dual screen setup script
The =dual_default.sh= script contains the following command (which should be
changed according to the monitor setup):

#+NAME: script-dual_default-sh
#+BEGIN_SRC sh

#!/bin/sh
# Setup screens
xrandr --output HDMI-0 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 1920x0 --rotate normal \
	   --output DP1 --off --output VGA-0 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 0x0 --rotate normal
#+END_SRC


* Utilities 
The =my_utility= module contains some helper functions used throughout the
configuration.

#+NAME: module-utility-imports
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

local awful = require("awful")
local naughty = require("naughty")
local beautiful = require("beautiful")

my_utility = {}
#+END_SRC


** String split

The =my_utility.lines= function splits the input string by rows.  A table with
the lines is returned; it can be iterated over using =for k, v in
pairs(lines_output)=.  This was taken from http://lua-users.org/wiki/SplitJoin.

#+NAME: module-utility-lines
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

function my_utility.lines(str)
   local t = {}
   local function helper(line) table.insert(t, line) return "" end
   helper((str:gsub("(.-)\r?\n", helper)))
   return t
end
#+END_SRC


** HTML escape

Notifications in awesome-wm accept HTML inputs, but there is no built-in
function to cleanup strings.  The =my_utility.html_escape= function provides
some very basic escaping.

#+NAME: module-utility-html_escape
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

function my_utility.html_escape(str)
   local t = str
   t = t:gsub("&", "&amp;")
   t = t:gsub("<", "&lt;")
   t = t:gsub(">", "&gt;")
   t = t:gsub("'", "&apos;")

   return t
end

function my_utility.filename_escape(str)
   local t = str

   t = t:gsub("[$]", "\\$")

   return t
end
#+END_SRC


** File listing

The =scandir= utility lists files in a given folder (from
http://stackoverflow.com/a/11130774).

#+NAME: module-utility-scandir
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

-- Lua implementation of scandir function
function my_utility.scandir(directory, pattern)
    local i, t, popen = 0, {}, io.popen
    for filename in popen('ls -a "'..directory..'/"'..pattern):lines() do
        i = i + 1
        t[i] = string.gsub(filename, "//", "/")
    end
    return t
end
#+END_SRC


** Table operations

#+NAME: module-utility-scandir
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

-- Remove paths from list of paths (based on last folder)
function my_utility.table_path_remove(table_in, remove_list)

   for i = 1, #remove_list do
      tstring = remove_list[i]
      for j = 1, #table_in do
         mstring = string.sub(table_in[j], -#tstring - 1, -2)
         if tstring == mstring then
            table.remove(table_in, j)
            break
         end
      end
   end

end
#+END_SRC



** Confirmation popup
The =my_utility.confirm_action= is used with the [[#shutdown][shutdown menu]] to prompt for
confirmation before performing actions (e.g. shutdown).  It uses a promptbox
placed on each wibox and runs the function =func= when the "y" character is
entered in the promptbox.  Note that, since the promptbox is barely visible, the
color of the whole wibox (on the current screen) is temporarily set to
=beautiful.bg_urgent= / =beautiful.fg_urgent=.

#+NAME: module-utility-confirm
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

function my_utility.confirm_action(func, name)
   awful.screen.focused().mywibox:set_bg(beautiful.bg_urgent)
   awful.screen.focused().mywibox:set_fg(beautiful.fg_urgent)
   awful.prompt.run {
         prompt = name .. " [y/N] ",
         textbox = awful.screen.focused().mypromptbox_conf.widget,
         exe_callback = function (t)
            if string.lower(t) == 'y' then
               func()
            end
         end,
         history_path = nil,
         done_callback = function ()
            awful.screen.focused().mywibox:set_bg(
               beautiful.screen_highlight_bg_active)
            awful.screen.focused().mywibox:set_fg(
               beautiful.screen_highlight_fg_active)
         end
   }
end
#+END_SRC

Here is an example of usage using =awesome-client=, with a screenshot of the
confirmation prompt on Fig.\nbsp{}[[img-confirm_action]].

#+NAME: sh-scrot-confirm_action
#+BEGIN_SRC sh

# Could get these from xrandr

** Run once
The =run_once= utility is a commonly used lua function to spawn a program if is
not already running.  The code is from
https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Autostart.

#+NAME: module-utility-run_once
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

function my_utility.run_once(prg, arg_string, pname, s, tag)
    if not prg then
        do return nil end
    end

    if not pname then
       pname = prg
    end

    if not arg_string then
       cmd_pgrep = pname
       cmd_exe = prg
    else
       cmd_pgrep = pname .. " " .. arg_string
       cmd_exe = prg .. " " .. arg_string
    end
    cmd = "pgrep -f -u $USER -x '" .. cmd_pgrep .. "' || (" .. cmd_exe .. ")"
    if s and tag then
       local pid = io.popen("pgrep -f -x '" .. cmd_pgrep .. "'"):read("*all")
       if pid == "" then
          awful.spawn(cmd_exe, { tag = screen[s].tags[tag] })
       end
    else
       awful.spawn.with_shell(cmd)
    end
end
#+END_SRC


** Return object

The module is instantiated by =local my_utility = require("my_utility")= and
functions are called using =my_utility.function(...)=.

#+NAME: module-utility-close
#+BEGIN_SRC lua

return my_utility
